# Portfolio design system

All shared values live in `styles/tokens.css`. `styles/base.css` defines typography and layout primitives; `styles/components.css` supplies reusable buttons and cards. `styles.css` contains only the loading screen.

## Colours

Every palette family has exactly ten steps: **50, 100, 200, 300, 400, 500, 600, 700, 800, 900**, lightest to darkest. The 500 value is the original supplied hex. Lighter tints and darker shades are generated defaults, ready for refinement against future Figma designs.

| Family | Original | Base token |
|---|---|---|
| fuchsia | `#F00FA9` | `--color-fuchsia-500` |
| rose | `#FC5698` | `--color-rose-500` |
| magenta | `#EB3EE6` | `--color-magenta-500` |
| purple | `#7300ED` | `--color-purple-500` |
| blue | `#546FFA` | `--color-blue-500` |
| sky | `#BFD0EE` | `--color-sky-500` |
| yellow | `#FEFE90` | `--color-yellow-500` |
| lime | `#B7E44B` | `--color-lime-500` |
| pink | `#FF91DC` | `--color-pink-500` |

Use semantic roles (`--color-primary`, `--color-text`, `--color-background`, `--color-border`) for interfaces. Purple is the default primary action; fuchsia is secondary, yellow is accent. All original hues are available independently. Text uses deep neutral, or white on primary purple. Verify contrast when combining other shades; not every colour pair is suitable for small text.

## Typography

- Headings: the actual Cooper LT BT Bold font, weight 700.
- Body, labels and buttons: Avant Garde Bold, weight 700.
- Body: 18px default, 1.6 line height. Button text: 16px, 1.25 line height.
- Fluid heading sizes, a 12�56px fixed type scale, and a fluid display size are provided.
- Font files are self-hosted; no external font service is required.

## Spacing and layout

Figma pixels are CSS pixels. Page padding is **20px on all four sides**, including mobile. Default pill-button padding is **15px top/bottom, 35px left/right**. Margin, padding and gaps share the same `--space-*` scale. Use `.page-shell`, `.stack`, `.cluster`, `.section-stack` and `.card`, or reference their tokens directly. The maximum content width is 1440px; default section gap 80px, content gap 24px, stack gap 16px, card padding 24px.

## Buttons and surfaces

```html
<button class="button">Primary action</button>
<a class="button button--secondary" href="#work">Explore work</a>
<button class="button button--accent">Playground</button>
<button class="button button--outline">Secondary action</button>
<button class="button button--flat">Without shadow</button>
```

Pill radius is the default. Buttons have a 5px drop shadow, hover/pressed states, a visible keyboard focus ring, and a minimum 44px touch target. Native disabled buttons and `aria-disabled="true"` links receive disabled styling; use native buttons for disabled actions. Radius tokens range from 8px to 32px, plus pill/circle. Smaller/larger shadow presets are available. The loader explicitly remains shadow-free.

## Responsive and motion rules

The animation tone is **fun, energetic, fast and snappy**. Keep this direction for future animations: short, punchy timing and crisp changes. The stationery intro uses four held stop-motion poses over 1.2 seconds, starts after loading, and holds the final pose without looping.

Use responsive layouts rather than scaling the entire page. Heading sizes are fluid; page/button padding keeps the requested measured values. Motion duration and easing are tokens. Reduced-motion preferences disable decorative animations and button movement. Component-specific geometry can remain local to that component; shared design values should come from tokens.

After the stationery intro, the logo/navigation pop into place in 200ms. The name sticker stamps down at 220ms, followed by the face sticker at 540ms. The entrance finishes at 800ms and holds still. Reduced-motion preferences reveal the finished composition immediately. Navigation destinations will be enabled as their sections are built; search has been removed. The selected navigation label uses palette yellow and the self-hosted Cooper LT BT Bold Italic font.

Once the entrance finishes, the face sticker and stationery can be picked up and dropped with mouse, touch or keyboard. The face crossfades to its peeled artwork while held, then flattens when released. Drop positions remain for the current visit; refreshing restores the designed composition and replays the intro. The face's curved “click me” hint disappears after moving it. Keyboard: Space/Enter picks up and drops, arrows move (Shift for larger steps), Escape cancels.
